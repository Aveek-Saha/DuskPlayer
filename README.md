<h3 align="center"> A minimalistic music player, designed for simplicity. <h3>


Built on electron, uses Howler for handling music playback, AngularJS and Bootstrap for the frontend, and music-metadata to retrieve ID3 tags.
 
This can also serve as a starting point to implement your own front-end/UI for a music Player.
