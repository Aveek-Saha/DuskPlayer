## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests.

## Pull Request Process

1. Open a new issue if one doesn't already exist for the pull request.
2. Check that a pull request doesn't already exist for the issue you are referencing.
3. Wait to be assigned the issue before creating a pull request.
   

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Aveek-Saha/MusicPlayer/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!
